# CarbonLLC Website - Webdev/Design service
Website of a discontinued business that I played a part in. CarbonLLC was active from 2019-2020 and focused on freelance web development and design. We worked on frontend and backend as well as UI/UX. Notable clients: https://kicks.gg/ (acquired by https://notify.org/), DropsSupreme (rebranded into https://drops.gg/),  https://tristatehype.io/, and more.
